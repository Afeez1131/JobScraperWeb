#Jobs_scraper


Motivation
I am in the Penultimate year of my University Education in Ladoke Akintola University of Technology.
I'm currently looking for a Django Backend Dev or Python programming role, but have found it frustrating that there are so many websites posting different jobs at different times. it becomes so difficult to continually check each websites to see what new jobs had been posted.

So i planned on automating the process, using a pipeline, which involved;
1. Scrape selected Job posting websites             done
2. Extract all new job posting at a regular interval from chosen websites automatically using heroku scheduler and Django Management         done
3. Check the new job posting against my skills and interests.       **
4. Automatically send Jobs that fit my criteria as email or SMS.	**
5. Turn it into a web application.

Extracting job details
The details that concerns me the most are
1. Job title
2. Date posted or Hour posted
3. Description if provided
4. The link to the job application.
